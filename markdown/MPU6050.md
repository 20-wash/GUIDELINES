# MPU6050

Use MPU6050 Library by `i2cdevlib by jrowberg`

## Install Library

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib.git
cd i2cevlib/Arduino
cp -r MPU6050 ~/Arduino
```

## Code

- **Pico**: https://github.com/Robotics-Club-Pulchowk/Arduino_Codes/blob/main/imu_pico/

    You also need `CRC8.hpp` and `CRC8.cpp`. You can download from below `ESP32 code` and keep them beside `.ino` file. 

- **ESP32**: https://github.com/Robotics-Club-Pulchowk/Arduino_Codes/blob/main/esp32_imu/

You should use `IMU_Zero` from examples to find offset for each `MPU6050`.

For pin loockup, see [this](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-Pulchowk/Arduino_Codes/tree/main/pin_loockup).

**Note: MPU6050 might not work after running 2-5 minutes if you do not ground the `AD0 Pin` for default address. The reason for this can be because of `AD0 Pin` floating above ground.**
